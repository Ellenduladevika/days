Gives the iOS and Mac App Store review Times in an app

Why does it exist
==

There is a website [appreviewtimes](http://appreviewtimes.com) which gives you an approximate day count of current App Store Review Trends by crowdsoursing the data.
There was no such App with a similar functionality, so I decided to make one.
I made it using some web scraping technique and an hour on Sunday.

As I knew it Apple rejected it. I got sad.
So I decided , why not open source the app so that other developers can still use it.

* It also has a notification center widget to have a quick look on the latest data
